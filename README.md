# First PCB â€“ Two-LED Board (Hack Club Highway)

This is my first-ever PCB. Itâ€™s a simple two-LED circuit designed as part of Hack Clubâ€™s [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/) tutorial from the Highway program. I used KiCAD for the schematic and PCB layout.

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This board lights up two LEDs. Thatâ€™s it.
- Designed entirely from scratch following the Hack Club tutorial.
